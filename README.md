## The experience I get in this project

(2025/07/13) I complete this project with knowledges of JavaScript I learned in the previous course. I use Javascript concepts such as module, async/await, dynamic import, JSON and flex to build a website with weather app inside. With advices in Assignment of the project, I use async function to fetch weather data with API provided form other websites and deal with errors. I initially build the application in console.log version, and finally add some UI to present the weather data with tidy layout on page. Futhermore, I use dynamic import() to load images elastically. I also design a loading effect when weather data is fetched, and use the network speeds simulation function in Devtools to test the effect. This activity strengthens my skills in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
